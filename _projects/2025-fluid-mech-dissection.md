In my Fluid Mechanics course (MAE 3230), we were tasked to **dissect a given fluid machine and make a 5 minute video describing the fluid concepts behind it** at the level of understanding for students currently taking the course.

My group was given a vacuum cleaner. As described in the video, we analyzed how the fan inside the vacuum cleaner generates a pressure difference across the vacuum that allows air and debris to be sucked in.

**Key fluid concepts:**
- Losses in flow through pipes
- Pumps

During this process, **my main role was centered around analyzing the pressure drop across the vacuum cleaner** (besides the filter). This included modeling the vacuum cleaner as a series of fluid-mechanical elements (pipes, elbows, orifice plate, expansion/contraction), measuring relevant dimensions, determining which equations to use to find the loss and pressure drop for each element, then applying them by making a MATLAB script. I also primarily worked on the slides and script for that portion of the video. 

**My biggest takeaways:** This assignment helped me better understand how fluids content applies to real machines and how to frame a system in a fluid-mechanical way. For example, when our group was a bit stuck on what to analyze, our professor said that our system was essentially "an actuator in a series of pipes". Once I looked at the system from that perspective, the goal and implementation of our analysis became much clearer. Additionally, analyzing a real system felt quite different from class examples since many approximations had to be made and we had to decide what we could or couldn't leave out.
