In my Fluid Mechanics course (MAE 3230), we were tasked to **dissect a given fluid machine and make a 5 minute video describing the fluid concepts behind it** at the level of understanding for students currently taking the course.

My group was given a vacuum cleaner. As described in the video, we modeled the vacuum as an actuator in a series of pipes to calculated the pressure drop across each element from the entrance (bottom) of the vacuum to the centrifugal blower, which allowed us to find the pressure drop and flowrate generated by the blower and therefore its efficiency. 

During this process, **my main role was centered around finding the pressure drop across each element** (besides the filter). This included breaking down the vacuum cleaner into different fluid mechanical elements (pipes, elbows, orifice plate, expansion/contraction), measuring relevant dimensions, determining which equations to use to find the loss and pressure drop for each element, then applying them by making a MATLAB script. I also primarily worked on the slides and script for that portion of the video.
