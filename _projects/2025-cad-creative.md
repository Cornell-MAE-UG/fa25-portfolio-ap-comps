For my Intro to Mechancial Design class, we were asked to CAD and render a challenging and interesting object of our choice. I started by drawing sketches of the object by hand, then designed and rendered the parts in Fusion 360.

I chose this staple remover since it had distinct parts, complex geometries, and interesting interactions between parts:

The object had multiple parts including metal brackets, plastic grips, a pin, and a coil. These were all designed separately, then integrated in an assembly.

<div class="inline-image-l">
    <video autoplay controls width="325px" height="240px">
        <source src="{{ 'assets/staple-remover-assembly-animation.mp4' | relative_url }}" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
</div>

Some challenges I faced included modeling the grips, as their numerous curves made it difficult to fully constrain the sketch. Additionally, I did not design the ends of the spring since they bent in real life when the brackets closed, which was unfeasible to animate for this assignment.
