In my first year on CUSail (2023-2024), my onboarding project with another new member was to design a mount for an Airmar sensor. We modeled it on SolidWorks to 3D-print with ABS and attached it to the boat.

The main considerations for the location and design of the mount included the sensor's specifications, the small size of the boat (and therefore limited space to place the mount), and the sturdiness of the mount.

This was my first official CAD project and a great learning experience for 3D-modeling.
