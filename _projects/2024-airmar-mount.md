In my first year on the CUSail (2023-2024) project team, my onboarding project with another new member was to design a mount for an Airmar sensor. We modeled it on SolidWorks to 3D-print with ABS and attached it to the boat.

The main considerations for the location and design of the mount included the sensor's specifications, the small size of the boat (and therefore limited space to place the mount), and the sturdiness of the mount.

While working on this project, we had to iterate a few times. The greatest change I made was after printing a prototype for testing, I discovered that although the diameter of the mount's hole was larger than that of the sensor's cable, because of the sharp 90 degree curve, the thick cable could not fit through. Therefore, I had to redesign the mount, making the curve more gradual and the end-opening wider. From this experience, I realized that there are sometimes less obvious factors that affect a design, so leaving time for testing and iteration is very important.

This was my first official CAD project and a great learning experience for 3D-modeling.
