My final project in Mechanics of Materials (MAE 3270) was to design a torque wrench to meet certain criteria and conduct an FEM analysis on it.

<div style="width: 250px; float: left; margin-left: 0; margin-bot: 0">
  <b>Key topics:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>Beam bending</li>
    <li>Principal stress</li>
    <li>Strain gauges</li>
    <li>Material properties</li>
    <li>Failure due to yield, fatigue, and fracture</li>
    <li>Static structural FEM</li>
  </ul>
</div>

**My biggest takeaways:**<br>
This project gave me experience selecting materials based on their properties. It also made me aware of how the boundary conditions of an FEM model can significantly impact stress calculations, both with artificial stress singularities and due to localized stress concentrations.
