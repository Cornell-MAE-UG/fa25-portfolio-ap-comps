#### Objective
Motivated mechanical engineering student with strong academics and project experience. Passionate about mechanical design and eager to apply and expand my knowledge in real-world applications.

---

#### Education
- **Cornell University**  
  *Bachelor of Science in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering*  
  GPA: 4.007/4.0 | Graduation: 05, 2027

- **Ashland High School**  
  *High School Diploma*  
  Graduation: 06, 2023

---

#### Skills
- **Software:** Autodesk Fusion 360, SolidWorks, Microsoft Office
- **Programming:** Python, MATLAB  
- **Tools:** 3D Printing, Laser Cutting  

---

#### Projects
- **[Keel and Ballast]**:  
  *Designed the keel and ballast for the 2024-2025 sailboat for CUSail*  
  - Devised novel connections between the hull, keel, and ballast so each part could be individually removed but also keep the hull watertight.
  - Designed a new keel and ballast shell with SolidWorks

- **[FEA Model]**:  
  *Developed FEA models to represent the physical models my group was conducting research on*  
  - Conducted dynamic analysis of an impact on a hyperelastic material in order to compare the behavior of the material to that detected by sensors in a physical model. 

- **[Spider Catcher]**:  
  *Collaborated with four other students in MAE2250 to design and develop a novel product with mechanical functions that solved a problem faced by people living in small apartments*  
  - Researched user needs through interviews, brainstormed potential solutions, then prototyped, tested, and iterated on our physical product before presenting it to the class  
  - Used CAD, laser-cutting, and hand tools to make physical prototypes

#### Work Experience
- **[Cornell University] - Grader**  
  [Aug, 2025] - [Dec, 2025]  
  - Grade homework and quizzes for ENGRD 2210: Thermodynamics

- **[Organic Robotics Lab (Cornell University)] - Summer Research Assistant**  
  [May, 2025] - [Aug, 2025]  
  - Learned how to use FEA and developed FEA models to represent the physical models my group was conducting research on.
  - Made optical strain sensors used for our physical model and 3D-printed and laser-cut parts needed for the experimental setups.

- **[LetGo YourMind STEM Programs] - Lead Counselor**  
  [July, 2024] - [Aug, 2024]  
  - Taught 5-20 children how to build and code LEGO robots and directed 1-2 junior counselors each week
