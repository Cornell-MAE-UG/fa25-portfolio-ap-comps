## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/Wang, April_IMG_7519.png" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a junior at Cornell University studying Mechanical Engineering. During my time at Cornell, I’ve joined the Cornell Autonomous Sailboat Project Team and the Organic Robotics Lab. These extracurricular choices were influenced by my desire to explore more about mechanical engineering and my potential future path, whether that be industry or graduate school. I hope to continue learning, obtaining new skills and experiences, and figuring out where my interests lie.

Aside from academics, I am on the competitive ballroom dancing team at Cornell. I also enjoy reading and crocheting in my free time.
